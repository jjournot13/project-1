# Background and Process
As data science students, we wanted to examine the potential career options and associated salaries for data science professionals. Our goal is to use the findings of this data analysis to identify career interests and how they align with potential future earnings.

# Data Source
We utlized https://ai-jobs.net/salaries/download/ which contains a global salary index for roles in the AI, Machine Learning, Data Science space based on information obtained through survey submissions and job postings with open salaries. After reviewing the dataset, we decided to filter it down to 2023 and jobs based in the U.S.

# Analysis Outline
We wanted to answer these four questions:

- What job roles are available for data science professionals?
- How does level of experience impact salary for data science professionals?
- What is the difference in salary based on the level of remote work?
- How does company size impact the type of data professionals they hire?

# Analysis Conclusion
- There is a positive relationship between earnings and experience level in the data science profession and therefore the more experience one gets the salary increases. However, you don't have to be an executive to earn the most money in this field.

- Salaries are similar for data professionals who work in person or fully remote work, while salaries for partially remote/hybrid tend to be lower. Not all jobs offer each level of remote work.

- The overall distribution of job titles varies among different company sizes. Medium-sized companies exhibit considerable variability and spread of job title count, large companies have a less variability closer to that of small companies, and small companies show low variability with a more concentrated distribution. 


# Contributions
Each group member ran the analysis and created visualizations for one of the questions.

- Linda analyzed the impact the level of experience has on salaries.
- Jenae analyzed the impact of the level of remote work on salaries.
- Jackie analyzed the impact of company size on type of data professionals they hire.
